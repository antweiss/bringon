bringon  - Build Registry (written in GOlaNg)

This is a RESTful webservice written in Golang.
The purpose of the service is to register software build results and metadata.

The far-fetched vision for this is to become the central information hub for distributed, 
loosely coupled microservice systems. 
Types of data we plan to support:
 * dependencies
 * API definitions 
 * consumer-driven contracts 
 * quality metrics and reports
 * real-time deployment info
 
 Integrations with systems like: Swagger, PACT broker, Taiga, Jira, Artifactory et al. are planned.
